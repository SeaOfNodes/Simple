# Chapter 22: Strings and Such

It's high time for Strings and printing!  In this chapter we look at what it
takes to make a nice user-mode string.  We are implementing strings in the base
Simple language (except for perhaps some minor Parser shortcuts).  This means
we'll need some canonical representation and a library of string functions.
