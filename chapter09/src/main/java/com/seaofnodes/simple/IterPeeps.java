/**
 * The IterOptim runs after parsing. It iterates the peepholes to a fixed point
 * so that no more peepholes apply.  This should be linear because peepholes rarely
 * (never?)  increase code size.  The graph should monotonically reduce in some
 * dimension, which is usually size.  It might also reduce in e.g. number of
 * MulNodes or Load/Store nodes, swapping out more "expensive" Nodes for cheaper
 * ones.
 *
 * The theoretical overall worklist is mindless just grabbing the next thing and
 * doing it.  If the graph changes, put the neighbors on the worklist.  Lather,
 * Rinse, Repeat until the worklist runs dry.
 *
 * The main issues we have to deal with:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Nodes have uses; replacing some set of Nodes with another requires more graph
 *   reworking.  Not rocket science, but it can be fiddly.  Its helpful to have a
 *   small set of graph munging utilities, and the strong invariant that the graph
 *   is stable and correct between peepholes.  In our case `Node.subsume` does
 *   most of the munging, building on our prior stable Node utilities.</li>
 *
 * <li>Changing a Node also changes the graph "neighborhood".  The neigbors need to
 *   be checked to see if THEY can also peephole, and so on.  After any peephole
 *   or graph update we put a Nodes uses and defs on the worklist.</li>
 *
 * <li>Our strong invariant is that for all Nodes, either they are on the worklist
 *   OR no peephole applies.  This invariant is easy to check, although expensive.
 *   Basically the normal "iterate peepholes to a fixed point" is linear, and this
 *   check is linear at each peephole step... so quadratic overall.  Its a useful
 *   assert, but one we can disable once the overall algorithm is stable - and
 *   then turn it back on again when some new set of peepholes is misbehaving.
 *   The code for this is turned on in `IterOptim.iterate` as `assert
 *   progressOnList(stop);`</li>
 * </ul>
