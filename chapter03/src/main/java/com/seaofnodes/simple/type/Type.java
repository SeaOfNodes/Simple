 * These types are part of a Monotone Analysis Framework,

 * <p> 
 * The types form a lattice; @see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order)">a symmetric complete bounded (ranked) lattice.</a>
 * <p>
 * This wild lattice theory will be needed later to allow us to easily beef up
 * the analysis and optimization of the Simple compiler... but we don't need it
 * now, just know that it is coming along in a later Chapter.
 * <p>g
 * One of the fun things here is that while the theory is deep and subtle, the
 * actual implementation is darn near trivial and is generally really obvious
 * what we're doing with it.  Right now, it's just simple integer math to do
 * simple constant folding e.g. 1+2 == 3 stuff.
