# Chapter 1

In this chapter we extend the language grammar to include arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, and unary minus. This allows us to write statements such as:

```
return 1 + 2 * 3 + -5;
```

Here is the [complete language grammar](docs/02-grammar.md) for this chapter.
